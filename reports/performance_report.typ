= Practice 2 Performance Report
== Indications
Create a minimal report (1 or 2 pages) that includes your key performance
visualizations with brief interpretations

- Confusion matrices (if applicable).
- Model calibration curve (see the last section of this document).
- Samples with highest loss values.
- Training losses, accuracies, etc.

Ensure proper figure formatting with axis labels, titles, and legends. Save figures at reasonable
resolutions. Structure your code to be modular and reusable.
Your report should be in PDF or HTML form, but include the original file too (word, markdown,
typstâ€¦). Include figure captions and brief explanations of what each visualization reveals.
